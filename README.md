# Twitter Tweet Wiper

This [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) uses a `tweets.js` from your Twitter archive and wipes **all** tweets.  
To use this project simply:

1. Request an archive on Twitter (Settings > Personal > Request Archive) & wait for it to be ready
2. Download your archive
3. Open it and extract the `tweets.js`. Place this file inside this directory.
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook.
5. While running the notebook will print out an URL and wait for an input. Open this URL in your browser, login to twitter and authorize this app.
6. **Your browser will fail to connect to the redirected address, but that's okay!!** Copy the URL and copy the **last** token. Paste this into the notebook prompt.

**THIS WILL WIPE ALL YOUR TWEETS.**  
**There is no way of recovering them, except for extracting from your archive and re-posting each tweet.**
